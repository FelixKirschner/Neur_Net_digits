# Neural Networks
Neural Network experimentation \n 
Code produces a neural network with a chosen number of hidden layers. \n
Learning is implemented using backpropagation.

Training data for simple testing can be either generated using the function in "gen_data.jl" file. The aim was to train a network to recognize handwritten digits reliably using the MNIST data set (available at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
